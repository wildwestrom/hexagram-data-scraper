The superior man is the warrior in the service of the Work, and although he is consciously aware of his task (he is vigilant during the day), he must remain alert to unconscious (night, or evening) factors which might usurp his judgment. This is alluded to in the Confucian commentary in terms of the awareness and control of speech. The control of language is extremely difficult, for it is by means of spontaneous remarks that unconscious forces often manage to express themselves despite all of our intentions to the contrary. It is for this reason that a common discipline of inner work is the strict control of expression -- for example, the vow not to use the word I in conversation.

   "Sand” often symbolizes time -- the innumerable petty details of life, or the inexorable wearing away of hours, minutes, seconds. When combined with the image of a river bank (Legge, Blofeld, Liu), the notion of waiting for time and events to fulfill themselves is further emphasized. Psychologically, to be spoken against refers to the impatient urging of the instinctual-emotional part of the psyche which demands immediate gratification of every current desire. Wilhelm renders being spoken against as gossip, which is rumor, speculation or imagination. (Cleary’s Buddhist text calls it “criticism.”) To exercise a “generous forbearance” means to endure and ignore these illusion-obsessed inner voices. Blofeld's note about watching what is going forward without taking part” is especially insightful: the line often portrays a situation in which one is required by circumstances to be an inactive observer. If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram created is number 63, Completion, suggesting that passive contemplation is linked with fulfillment of the Work.",

A dynamic line in the central place in the lower trigram shows how there will be good fortune if one maintains apprehensive caution; but because contention should not be taken to extremes, there will be evil if one prosecutes his contention to the bitter end.

   "The upper trigram of Strength here controls the lower trigram of Peril which is trying to attack it. Or it may also be seen as someone in a perilous situation contending with strong outside forces. The image is of contention and strife. The sincere yang line in the middle of the trigram of Peril gives a character to the whole figure -- an individual so represented will be very cautious and have good fortune. But since contention is bad, even a sincere individual must fail if he pursues it to the bitter end. The fifth line represents the great man, whose agency is sure to be good. His decision in any matter of contention will be correct.

The distinction to be made is to see the difference between the minister in line four and the ruler in line five -- i.e., don't overstep your authority or aspire above your proper place.

Nose: Intuition, subtle discrimination, as: I smell a rat.” The various translators indicate that the nose is either injured or buried in the meat, suggesting that the intuitive faculty is damaged or obscured by an overly easy act of mental discrimination. A simplistic comprehension goes too far, but since the idea of No Blame is attached to the line this seems to be a natural consequence of the situation. A syllogism might go like this: Drunk drivers are bad. George is a drunken driver, therefore George is bad.” This is the easy discrimination. The subtlediscrimination is that George, normally a modest drinker, was required by his Embassy job to drink toasts with the Russian ambassador and he miscalculated his capacity to hold his liquor.

But change is eternal, and here we see the beginnings of recovery from the former situation. Return is associated with the time of the winter solstice when the sun begins its journey back toward summer. In harmony with these cycles in nature are the cycles in human affairs.",

   "The hexagram of RETURN, applied to character formation, contains various suggestions. The light principle returns; thus the hexagram counsels turning away from the confusion of external things, turning back to one’s inner light. There, in the depths of the soul, one sees the Divine, the One. It is indeed only germinal, no more than a beginning, a potentiality, but as such clearly to be distinguished from all objects. To know this One means to know oneself in relation to the cosmic forces. For this One is the ascending force of life in nature and in man."},

   "Implicit here is the idea that there are many lessons to be learned and reinforced when one undertakes the Work, and uncertainty and vacillation are to be expected. Often we expect more of ourselves than we are capable of performing. One doesn't learn how to be a mountain climber by immediately attempting to scale Mt. Everest. The Work is a task of many lifetimes, involving the step by step integration of countless disparate complexes within the psyche. Occasionally we may get off the path, but as long as we remain committed to the Work we must always return -- hopefully having learned something from our temporary detour. This is not a justification for a failure of willpower, but it is a recognition that such failures exist here in the World of the Senses. Blofeld's interpretation of the Confucian commentary can be misleading -- the no blame or no error proviso in the original line derives from our recognition that we have gotten off the path and are determined to return to it, not usually that we are entirely free of culpability. On the other hand, the line can sometimes represent a recurring issue in which personal blame is not an obvious factor: one just has to deal with it until it’s resolved.

This is the nature of water -- it flows on, without accumulating its volume so as to overflow; it pursues its way through a dangerous defile, without losing its true nature. That the mind is penetrating is indicated by the dynamic line in the center. Advance in accordance with this will be followed by achievement. The dangerous height of heaven cannot be ascended; the difficult places of the earth are mountains, rivers, hills and mounds.

   "There is apparently more than one way to translate this line, best seen in the contrast between Cleary’s Taoist and Buddhist versions. One implies that frivolity is an antidote to depression, the other that both positions are extreme. Emphasized in all translations is the contrast between joy and sorrow, singing and groaning, youth and old age. The setting sun symbolizes the decline of awareness, the darkening of the light, the advance of illusion. That is: to either mindlessly sing or to bewail one's fate is to be deluded -- one has forgotten one's Source. Frivolity and despair are polarized attitudes, and the line tells us that clarity wanes whenever one takes an extreme position. In another context, the setting sun suggests the inevitability of death. Those who believe that death is final usually respond in either of the two ways shown, and thus miss the mark. There is also a suggestion of the futility of trying to hold onto something that is by nature transitory. Note the similarity between this line and line three of Hexagram #61,Inner Truth: “He finds a comrade. Now he beats the drum, now he stops. Now he sobs, now he sings.” Wing’s paraphrase is probably the best.",

Literally the text says the king's mother, but king's father and king's mother are well-known Chinese appellations for grandfather and grandmother. This is the view given on the passage by Ch'eng-tzu, Chu Hsi and the K'ang-hsi editors. They all agree that the name points us to line five, the correlate of two, and the ruler of the hexagram. Line five is the sovereign who at length acknowledges the worth of the feudal ruler, and gives her the great blessing. I am not sure that motherly king would not be the best and fairest translation of the phrase.

Our hypothesis is that, although the symbolism emerging from the objective psyche takes different forms in different cultures, it always describes the same general archetypes. We are justified therefore in comparing this line with an analogous concept from the Kabbalah: the sphere of awareness called Binah. Binah corresponds to the Chinese notion of the primordial Yin -- the essence of the Feminine. Canon McClatchie's association of Juno, the wife of Imperial Heaven, to this line could as well apply to Binah. In the Kabbalah, Binah is closely associated with sorrow -- identical with Our Lady of Sorrows in Catholic Christian symbolism. What is being conveyed in this line then, is the growth potential inherent in adversity. Kabbalists may note similarities here with the symbolism of the 17th Path of the Tree of Life.",

Although any two opposite genders might feel a mutual attraction, there is really only one opposite which is an appropriate spouse.

Cleary’s version of the Confucian commentary reads: “Rising into the unknown on high dissolves poverty.” This seems to be the exact opposite of all the other translations. (Wilhelm’s rendering is the most succinct:“At the top is decrease and not wealth.”) Cleary’s rendition is based on Chi-hsu Ou-I’s Buddhist commentary, which states: “When one rises into the unknown, then one can stop; but if one is unceasingly correct, then one should rise yet further into the unknown. This is what is called spiritual rank. If they cultivate spiritual rank, people of low social status are not really poor and lowly – their poverty can disappear.” Since Chi-hsu Ou-i was not a translator, but reading and writing in his own language, one wonders how such a seemingly anomalous interpretation of Confucius could occur.

In disgrace and danger, his death will soon come; is it possible for him in such circumstances to see his wife? The K'ang-hsi editors say here: The subjects of the three magnetic lines (one, three and six) are all unable to cope correctly with the oppression of their circumstances. The first is at the bottom, sitting and distressed. The third line, able either to advance or retreat, advances and is distressed. Wounded abroad, he returns to his family and finds no one to receive him: a graphic portrayal of the results of reckless action.",

   "This line does not lend itself to the usual gender symbolism. The rock is often a symbol of eternity, and is seen as a dwelling place for spiritual beings, hence: a transcendental reality or eternal verity. In fairy tales a barrier of thorns is often created by an evil witch or other negative magnetic force -- the feminine principle in its destructive aspect. This barrier is usually what separates the hero from the sleeping maiden, his unconscious anima or feminine soul. A house or palace is the whole psyche. (In my father's house are many mansions. -- John 14:2) The wife of course, is the contra-sexual correlate: in a man, the anima, or emotional-feeling component of his psyche. (A woman receiving this line should just reverse the symbolism and see it as the animus, or logical-thinking component of her psyche.) Putting all these symbols together we receive an image of a situation which is somehow contrary to the laws of nature. Both the frowning rock (yang) and the thorns (yin) are opposed to the situation, so no union can possibly take place: He does not see his wife.  If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram created is number twenty-eight, Critical Mass, with a corresponding line which indicates a position of extreme vulnerability to danger. This line is an unambiguous warning that your situation is untenable -- both dynamic and magnetic forces are against you. Ritsema/Karcher translate pitfall as: Leads away from the experience of meaning; stuck and exposed to danger, unable to take in the situation; flow of life and spirit is blocked... Wilhelm alludes to immanent death, which, of course, should be interpreted symbolically in most cases.",

Line six is advised to learn from her observation of line five's troubles to remain calm and stationary, out of the fray.

The clear message here is one of adopting an unconventional or independent point of view: survival now depends on not following the crowd.

   "Keeping Still, or doing “nothing,” is probably the most difficult thing that a human can be asked to do. We are an ever-flowing fountain of restless desire -- the senses are mindlessly programmed to encounter their objects, and when we prevent them from doing this, a great commotion occurs in the psyche. We are so accustomed to feeling our desires, drives, instincts and appetites as integral to our awareness, that we are seldom conscious of the fact that they are actually autonomous forces -- as separate from the ego, or choice-making complex, as we are from other people, creatures or objects in the physical world. Try controlling an ingrained habit, such as smoking, and observe how difficult it is to impose your will upon it. Who controls whom?",

As the top line of the lower trigram, this is a place of transition between a lower and higher condition, and the imagery describes the conflict which ensues whenever one undertakes such a separation. Blofeld's note about sexuality is very apt here: the Self is capable of testing one's will to the very limits of endurance on this issue; indeed, control of sexual libido is one of the cornerstones of the Work and cannot be evaded. The concept of the cessation of desire itself is easily understood, yet all but impossible to achieve.

[The additional Chinese commentaries explain that the wild goose is a bird which moves toward the sun. Now, a commonly used Chinese term for the sun is YANG, namely the male principle. So the bird obviously (sic) betokens a maiden seeking a husband. Its movement from river bank to rock, dry land, a tree, a hillock and the mainland (which is said in one commentary to mean peninsula) signifies gradual movement in an unchanging direction. From the point of view of divination, this is the best course for us, even if marriage is not our objective. Regarding marriage: the first line betokens gossip, although the marriage is not unsuitable; the second, a materially successful marriage; the third, an unfortunate marriage; the fourth, marriage to someone exceedingly kind and thoughtful; the fifth, a blissful marriage; the sixth, marriage to a public figure who has some responsibility for good order within the realm and who succeeds in his task.]"},

(Wilhelm) Notice also that the message for the superior man in this Image is almost identical with that in Discernment:Thus the kings of former times made firm the laws through clearly defined penalties. (Wilhelm) The ancient kings can always be taken as symbolic of archetypal forces (the gods), so their laws are those of nature, not of humankind.

The intercourse of heaven and earth alternates between abundance and scarcity. It waxes and wanes according to the seasons. How much more so with men or spiritual forces!

   "Blofeld renders the line as: Joy in the form of allurement.” Wilhelm uses the concept of seduction to illustrate the idea, and Liu says: enticement. Shaughnessy’s“shadowy usurpation” suggests a kind of demonic possession, and sometimes this interpretation feels more accurate than any of the others. It is instructive to note that Wilhelm's commentary on this line states that the seduction refers to the situation confronting the querent rather than the querent's attitude per se: It rests with him whether he will let himself be seduced.  Intrapsychically, you are being self-indulgent toward an inferior impulse or emotion.",

The lessons to be learned from the figure are the differences between self-indulgence and maintaining emotional stability in one's conduct of the Work, which always demands a firm control over one’s affects. To receive this hexagram without changing lines requires the querent's careful discrimination -- it can mean simply: Oh happy day! Or, it can suggest that you examine an inclination toward lack of control in the situation at hand.

   "There are two sets of images here -- the first suggests an accumulation of latent energy and the second the grasp of something concealed. Rain symbolizes the union of heaven and earth -- the connection between higher and lower, inner and outer. Dense clouds therefore represent a buildup of unreleased tension: union has yet to be accomplished. The arrow shot into the cave with a line attached to it traditionally symbolizes the link between this line’s magnetic second-line correlate. (Meditation on the differences between the two lines and their respective messages is often useful in discerning subtle ego/Self relationships.) The arrow suggests discrimination or comprehension -- to shoot an arrow into the heart of something is a conscious, active attempt to pierce its essence, to comprehend it. To shoot into the darkness of a cave symbolizes seeking comprehension of what is unknown or unconscious; it can also suggest a shot in the dark -- a guess. Only Legge identifies the target as a bird – the other translations are less specific: the object is “something or someone” hidden from consciousness. As a creature of the air, a bird represents thoughts, ideas, concepts, intelligible answers, etc. , so this often applies in the interpretation. (Note how central the bird symbol is in this hexagram.) The line suggests one seeking comprehension of an unknown situation or process and receiving relatively little satisfaction -- the answer is out of reach (too high) in the imagery of the Confucian commentary. If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram created is Number 31, Influence, which often carries the connotation of “importuning” – suggesting that perhaps you are seeking information which the oracle has no intention of providing, or you are incapable of understanding at this stage: it’s too high, it’s beyond you. (See commentary on Hex 31 for more details.) Also compare this line with the virtually identical message in the Judgement of Hexagram 9: ’TheTaming Power of the Small has success. Dense clouds, no rain from our western region.’ This repetition of the theme of ’smallness’ (in all of its possible connotations) is useful to contemplate here.",

Just as the seasons of the year change and pursue an ever-recurring round, so it is with the phases of society. The reign of order has peaked and declined, and this hexagram calls us to renew the struggle to make things right again. It deals with the conduct necessary to secure this result.",

   "There is serious ambiguity here. I asked the oracle to comment on the situation of this line, and received hexagram 18:4 -- You cannot succeed until you rectify a past mistake. Then I asked what would be the effect of adding the negative to the line, and received hexagram 22:2 and 5 -- Form follows function, and, A small offering is appreciated.  As far as I am concerned, the answer is clear: the line doesn't make sense unless the negative is replaced. We are dealing with a book which was first written down in 1143 BC, and copied by hand for more than two-thousand years before it was first printed. In editing this edition I have caught myself making copying errors more than once, so it is easy to appreciate the problems involved in maintaining accuracy over millennia.",
